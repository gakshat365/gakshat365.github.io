Features
Themes
There are different themes you can try out, like Cyberpunk, Matrix, and Vaporwave. Each one changes how the site looks — fonts, colors, animations, etc.

You can also pick your own accent color.

Preferences get saved so the site remembers what you like.

There’s a reset button too, in case you want to start fresh.

Interactions
The intro section has a typing animation (because static text is boring).

Skill bars fill up as you scroll.

There’s an image carousel that runs on its own.

Education is shown as a timeline.

There’s also a little text analysis tool to count words and characters.

Design
Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Has smooth transitions and animations.

A scroll progress bar at the top.

Sidebar navigation that you can collapse if needed.
